:: Step 2: Build the lower level libraries via cmake. Use first command for vcpkg dir, second for generator and third for qtdir.
cmake -G %1 -B ./build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%2

if %1 == "Ninja" (
    ninja -C build
) else (
    msbuild build/Kyanite.sln
)

:: Step 3: Build the swift package
swift build -Xlinker lib\Debug\Audio.lib -Xlinker lib\Debug\EntityComponentSystem.lib -Xlinker lib\Debug\ImGUI.lib -Xlinker lib\Debug\Input.lib -Xlinker lib\Debug\IO.lib -Xlinker lib\Debug\System.lib -Xlinker lib\Debug\Rendering.lib

:: Copy all C++ dlls to the swift package directory
robocopy "bin/Debug" "./.build/x86_64-unknown-windows-msvc/debug" "*.dll"
:: Also copy all pdb files
robocopy "bin/Debug" "./.build/x86_64-unknown-windows-msvc/debug" "*.pdb"
